API in Node.js/Express exposing 3 endpoints to GET and POST random user data. It makes asynchronous requests 
to retrieve our data initially from a 3rd party API ("https://randomuser.me/api").

Used the following:

Express.js
axios module to make requests
morgan module to log requests to console
body-parser module to parse incoming request bodies
